DDL Script: Create Gold Views
===============================================================================
Script Purpose:
    This script creates views for the Gold layer of the data warehouse.

    The Gold layer represents the final business-ready dimension and fact
    views used for analytics and reporting.

    The script creates:
        1. gold.dim_customers
        2. gold.dim_product
        3. gold.fact_sales

    Each view transforms and combines data from the Silver layer to produce
    clean, enriched, and business-ready datasets following a Star Schema
    design.

Usage:
    - Execute this script after the Silver layer has been successfully loaded.
    - The created views can be queried directly for analytics and reporting.
